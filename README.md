# Maze-Solver
A program that attempts to solve a maze through the use of machine learning and neural networks

Uses javascript with the P5.js framework (I know it is a strange choice for machine learning and neural network but I have been trying to learn it and decided to challenge myself).

Inspired by:
  - Daniel Shiffman from 'The Coding Train' Youtube Channel (Love this guy) (https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)
  - Youtuber Sethbling's MarI/O Program (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) (Utilizes the NEAT algorithm)
  - 'The Hitch-Hikers Guide to Artificial Intelligence' by Richard Forsyth and Chris Naylor (A book from 1985) (Things haven't really change since then, the algorithms are still very applicable) (Be prepared to learn Applesoft Basic, an assembly language, if you plan to use as a code resource, however the logic is still very useful without an understanding of Applesoft Basic)
